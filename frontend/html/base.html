"Aubrey Drake Graham was born on October 24, 1986, in Toronto, Ontario.
He is the son of Dennis Graham, a drummer who worked with Jerry Lee Lewis,
and Sandi Graham, an educator. Two of his uncles, Larry Graham and Teenie
Hodges, are also musicians.[3][4][5] Graham's father is an African American
from Memphis, Tennessee, and Graham's mother is a white Jewish Canadian. He
attended a Jewish day school and had a Bar Mitzvah.[6][7][8] His parents
divorced when he was five years old, and he was raised by his mother in
Toronto's wealthy Forest Hill neighbourhood.[9][10] Graham attended high
school at Forest Hill Collegiate Institute, where he began acting,[11] but
did not graduate.[12] He spent most summers with his father in Memphis.[13]
Graham stated that his parents' divorce greatly affected him as a person,
saying, ?I had to become a man very quickly and be the backbone for a woman
who I love with all my heart, my mother."[14]"
