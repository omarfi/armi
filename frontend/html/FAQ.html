	  "Aubrey Drake Graham was born on October 24, 1986, in Toronto,
	  Ontario.
	  He is the son of Dennis Graham, a drummer who worked with Jerry Lee
	  Lewis,
	  and Sandi Graham, an educator. Two of his uncles, Larry Graham and
	  Teenie
	  Hodges, are also musicians.[3][4][5] Graham's father is an African
	  American
	  from Memphis, Tennessee, and Graham's mother is a white Jewish
	  Canadian.	  He
	  attended a Jewish day school and had a Bar Mitzvah.[6][7][8] His
	  parents
	  divorced when he was five years old, and he was raised by his mother
	  in
	  Toronto's wealthy Forest Hill neighbourhood.[9][10] Graham attended
	  high
	  school at Forest Hill Collegiate Institute, where he began acting,[11]
	  but
	  did not graduate.[12] He spent most summers with his father in
	  Memphis.[13]
	  Graham stated that his parents' divorce greatly affected him as a
	  person,
	  saying, ?I had to become a man very quickly and be the backbone for a
	  woman
	  who I love with all my heart, my mother."[14]"
