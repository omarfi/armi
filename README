	-- Automated Room Management Interface

Database Structure:

	 Preferences: storing generic preference types; we have no
	 duplicated preferences in this table;
		      
         Modified Preferences: preferences that are set to some value
         by the user; they have to live within a set of preferences;

	 Preference Set: a collection of (modified / generic)
	 preferences; these can belong either to a user or to a room; 

	 Users, Rooms: self-explanatory; room_set points to a
	 preference set which describes the preferences implementable
	 in the given room;

PHP Objects: (behaviour)

	Room: modify implementable preferences (in the generic
	preference set); list preferences mapped to that room
	(room_set points to a preference set, which points to all
	preferences in the set); get all sets mapped to a room;

	User: can create a room; create a new preference set; get all
	of previous;

	Preference: create / modify preferences;

	Preference Set: create / modify set; return all preferences in
	a given set;
